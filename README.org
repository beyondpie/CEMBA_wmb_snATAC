* CEMBA_wmb_snATAC
This repository is used for the whole mouse brain (wmb) snATAC-seq data analysis
of Center for Epigenomics of the Mouse Brain Atlas (CEMBA), which is now published in Nature 2023 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06824-9).

* Change Log
1. 2025-03-22: add zenodo link to store
   - subclass-specific CREs using SnapATAC2 differential anaysis. 
1. 2024-10-19: add google drive link for 2.3 million cell meta data.
2. 2024-09-25: add explanation in Discusssion for 4D and 4E dissections.

* Important Note
All the analysis and the h5ad data generated are from SnapATAC2 under <= 2.4.0
There are some [[https://kzhang.org/SnapATAC2/changelog.html][break changes]] later after SnapATAC2 >= 2.5.0

** Data
- Our dissection 4D annotated in the meta data, should be 4E; and 4E should be 4D. 
  - This might be a label issue during experiment record. We are not that sure.
  - Check the disccusion for details info: https://github.com/beyondpie/CEMBA_wmb_snATAC/discussions/20 .
  - In our repository, we keep everything now unchanged. So if you need 4D region, you should give 4E a look and vice versa.
- Demultiplexed data can be accessed via the NEMO archive (NEMO,
  RRID:SCR_016152) at https://assets.nemoarchive.org/dat-bej4ymm (the
  raw directory under Source Data URL in this archive).
- We also uploaded our demultiplexed fastq files and processed files
  under the GEO accession number GSE246791:
  - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE246791
- Processed data is also available on our web portal and can be explored here: http://www.catlas.org.
  - A Google drive link for bigwig files and SnapATAC2 files just for backup:
    - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mule-CkxN939mxhYAqpOIxjPpq0j8qVP?usp=sharing
- All the cellmeta information:
  - Google drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UNeOar5UuBNrIjB_z53s25nrm81arXPW?usp=share_link
- Sublcass-level DA (differential accessibiility) results:
   Zenodo link: https://zenodo.org/records/15069866

** Pipeline
    - We now have 234 samples and 2.3 million cells in total. So most
      of the analysis are depend on *Snakefile* to organize the pipeline
      and submit them to high-performance cluster (HPC) in order to
      use hundreds of CPUs at the same time.
    - R, Shell and Python (>= 3.10) are mainly used, especially R (>= 4.2).
    - Under the directory [[./package][package]], we put lots of common functions there.
    - We mainly use [[https://github.com/kaizhang/SnapATAC2][SnapATAC2]] to analyze the single-nucleus ATAC-seq data
    - Comparation between Scrublet and AMULET: https://github.com/yuelaiwang/CEMBA_AMULET_Scrublet 
    - The deep learning related codes now in the repo: https://github.com/yal054/mba_dl_model
    - *sa2* is short for *SnapATAC2* in this repo.

** Codes
*** Clustering
    In total, we have implemented four-round iterative clustering.
    See details in [[file:01.clustering][01.clustering]]
*** Integration and annotation
    We use Allen's scRNAseq data and their annotations for our data annotation.
    See details in [[file:02.integration][02.integration]]
*** Peak calling
   We use macs2 with multiple stage filtering, especially use SPM >= 5
   for filtering peaks.
   See details in [[file:03.peakcalling][03.peakcalling]]
*** Comments on some scripts:
1. [[file:package/R/cembav2env.R][cembav2env.R]]: R env to store the metadata during analysis.
